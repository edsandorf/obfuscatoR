# obfuscatoR
Chorus et al. 2019 put forward the hypothesis that sometimes when people make choices they wish to hide their true motivation from a potential onlooker. The obfuscatoR package allows researchers to easily create experimental designs to test the obfuscation hypothesis, i.e. when properly incentivized are people able to obfuscate?

The package can be installed from CRAN `install.packages("obfuscatoR")`

Alternatively, if you want to install the development version, feel free to do so from Github `devtools::install_github("edsandorf/obfuscatoR")`
